# Staaaaaaaaaaaack

This mod allows dropped items to merge, even if their stacks are already full. This can help reduce lag caused by a large number of drops in a small area.

It should be compatible with most mods, but please report any issues if it does not work for the mod you're playing with.

The name contains 12 'a's btw. üçî

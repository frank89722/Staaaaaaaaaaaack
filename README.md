# Staaaaaaaaaaaack [![](https://img.shields.io/modrinth/dt/myL7fuqp?label=modrinth)](https://modrinth.com/mod/staaaaaaaaaaaack) [![](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/short_staaaaaaaaaaaack_downloads.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/staaaaaaaaaaaack) 

This mod allows dropped items to merge, even if their stacks are already full. This can help reduce lag caused by a large number of drops in a small area.

It should be compatible with most mods, but please report any issues if it does not work for the mod you're playing with.

Current features:
- Merging drops over their stack limit without changing the actual maximum stack size
- Customizable merge distance for drops.
- Customizable maximum size for drops.
- Customizable overlay size and render distance.
- Blacklist configuration for items that you don't want to exceed their default stack limit. You can add them from the common config file or assign them a specific item tag.

The name contains 12 'a's btw. üçî
